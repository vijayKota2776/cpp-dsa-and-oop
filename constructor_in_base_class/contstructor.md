Define an abstract class names "base1" which has the following members:<br>
1. a: an integer type varable under private visibility label.<br>
2. Define an inline parameterized constructor to initialize data member "a".<br>
3. get_a(): an inline protected member function which returns value of "a".<br>


Define an abstract class named "base2" which has the following members:<br>
1. b: an integer type variable under private visibility label.<br>
2. Define a inline parameterized constructor to initialize data member "b".<br>
3. get_b(): an inline public member function which return value of "b".<br>

Define  a class named "derived" which is derived from "base1" and "base2" under public and protected mode respectively it has the following member: <br>
1. z: an integer type variable under private visiblity label.<br>
2. show(): an inline private member function which displays value of "z".<br>
3. Define an inline parameterized constructor to initialize data member "z" with product of "a" and "b" if futher callls member function show().<br>
Define an appropriate main function.<br>
