	1.	d1, d2, d3 of type double under the private visibility label.
	2.	Define a private member function named process, which finds the smallest of d1, d2, and d3 and displays the smallest value.
	3.	Define a parameterized constructor function that initializes the private data members.
Write the relevant main function to complete the program.
