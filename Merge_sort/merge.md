Define a class name merge consisting of the following members:<br>
1. a,b,c: 1d-array of type short integer of size 50 each under private visibility label.<br>
2. m,n: of type short unsigned intger (indicater total number of element in a and b respectively ) under private visibility label.<br>
3. define a default constructor to accept data members "m"and "n" and to accept the number in the array a and b (both in ascending order) it further calls member function "process"<br>
4. define a private member function named "process" which performs merging of all elements in a and b to obtain array c in ascending order for display.<br>
Write a relevant main function to complete the program<br>
