Define a class "base" having one private member num1 and one public data member num2 both of type float. Define public member function:<br>
1. input_data(): to read data value num1.<br>
get_num1(): to return the value of num1.<br>
Extend class base to anther class derived using public derivation, define for class derived a private data member dum which is to be calculated by adding num1 and num2 and a public member function.<br>
get_data(): to read num2 and to call input_data() for readingvalue to add tp compute sum.<br>
show_data(): to output num1,num2 and sum.<br>
Write a main()to create object of type derived and input and output all data code.<br>
